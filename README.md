Relaxation method solver
========================
## Problem
Attempt to a solution for a perturbed linearized radiative transfer equation with coherent scattering terms.

## Method
Iterative solution that takes an initial guess for an intensity grid to solve for the difference between each point of the grid and the actual solution, and add this âˆ†I to the initial guess.

## Installation

Make sure a package manager such as `brew` or `apt-get` is available

If *Python 3* and/or *git* are **not** installed then install w/ dependencies using:
	
	brew install python
	brew install python3
	brew install git
	pip3 install numpy
	pip3 install matplotlib
	
> For *Linux* systems replace `brew install` with `sudo apt-get` 

- To download and install on *MacOS/Linux*:

		git clone https://github.com/pboserman/Relaxation.git
		cd Relaxation

- To allow updating:

	* Create a GitHub account.
	* On Repostory page click on **Fork** to fork to your profile
	* Run:

			git clone https://github.com/{username}/Relaxation.git 
			cd Relaxation
			git remote add upstream https://github.com/pboserman/Relaxation.git

	* Then to update local files:
	
			git pull upstream master
			
## Recommended installation

For interactive usage download *iPython*:

	brew install ipython

Then go to root directory and run:

	ipython
	run index.py
	
> *iPython* is an interactive *Python* shell that allows access to existing variables within the scope of the file ran.
> This is very useful for debugging and testing
	

## Usage
* To run the program, go to to root folder and run:
		
		python3 index.py

* Options can be set in the *opt.py* file in the root directory. 

* In order to make custom runs, look at the commented available methods within *index.html*.
